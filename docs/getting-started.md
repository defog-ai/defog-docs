# Getting Started

Let's discover **Defog in less than 5 minutes**. Here's a 1-minute demo of the setup

<ReactPlayer playing controls url='https://github.com/defog-ai/defog-docs/assets/113582788/4fdad08c-e3fe-49bc-af1b-a975f875c95d' />

## What you'll need
- A Defog API Key. Sign up [here](https://defog.ai/signup/) for a free API key
- Python 3
- Pip
- Drivers for your database

If you do not have `pip` installed on your computer, you can install it [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)


## Initializing Defog

Get started by install our [CLI interface](https://github.com/defog-ai/defog-python).

To do this, just run the following commands on your terminal

```bash
pip install --upgrade defog
defog init
```

From here, you can just follow the instructions in the CLI wizard to get started!

**Important Note:** Doing this does not send your database credentials to Defog! This is only done so we can get your database metadata (table names, column names, column descriptions), and so you can execute the queries generated by Defog locally on your machine.


## Generating a Google Sheet for your metadata

To generate a Google Sheet for your metadata, just list all the tables names you want, separated by a space.

```bash
defog gen <table1> <table2> <table3> ...
```

If you are using MongoDB, replace the names of the tables with that of a collection.

An example Google Sheet that this will generate is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jn4dXN07Uv1xONBg-AyDpwtRNeNKwG-mzVc-qnR7JwA/edit#gid=20778776)

Once generated, you can edit the Google Sheet to give an accurate description of your metadata. We have included steps to do that [in this Cookbook](https://defog.notion.site/Cookbook-for-schema-definitions-1650a6855ea447fdb0be75d39975571b).

## Uploading your metadata

To upload your metadata to Defog, just pass in your google sheets url via defog update

```bash
defog update link_of_google_sheets_url
```

For example, if your GSheets URL is https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jn4dXN07Uv1xONBg-AyDpwtRNeNKwG-mzVc-qnR7JwA/edit, you should just run `defog update https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jn4dXN07Uv1xONBg-AyDpwtRNeNKwG-mzVc-qnR7JwA/edit`

## Making a test query

One your metadata has been updated, you can start making test queries. An example query is below

```bash
defog query 'how many users do we have?'
```

## (Optional) Deploying to AWS Lambda or GCP Functions

If you want to deploy Defog a a microservice on your cloud, you can run the following functions:

```bash
# for AWS Lambda
# before this, you must install chalice with `pip install chalice`
defog deploy aws
```

```bash
# for GCP Functions
# before this, you must have gcloud installed on your machine
defog deploy gcp
```

Once you do this, you will see the API endpoint for your microservice in your console
