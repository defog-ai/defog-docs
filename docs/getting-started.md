# Getting Started

Let's discover **Defog in less than 5 minutes**. Here's a 1-minute demo of the setup

<ReactPlayer playing controls url='https://github.com/defog-ai/defog-docs/assets/113582788/4fdad08c-e3fe-49bc-af1b-a975f875c95d' />

## What you'll need
- A Defog API Key. Sign up [here](https://defog.ai/signup/) for a free API key
- Python 3
- Pip
- Drivers for your database

If you do not have `pip` installed on your computer, you can install it [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)


## Initializing Defog

Get started by install our [CLI interface](https://github.com/defog-ai/defog-python).

To do this, just run the following commands on your terminal

```bash
pip install --upgrade 'defog[snowflake]'
# If you're not using Snowflake, then you can replace the above with
# pip install --upgrade 'defog[postgres]' or pip install --upgrade 'defog[mysql]' or pip install --upgrade 'defog[bigquery]'
defog init
```

From here, you can just follow the instructions in the CLI wizard to get started!

**Important Note:** Doing this does not send your database credentials to Defog! This is only done so we can get your database metadata (table names, column names, column descriptions), and so you can execute the queries generated by Defog locally on your machine.


## Generating a CSV file for your metadata

To generate a CSV file that contains your metadata, just list all the tables names you want, separated by a space.

```bash
defog gen <table1> <table2> <table3> ...
```

Once generated, you can edit the CSV to give an accurate description of your metadata. We have included steps to do that [in this Cookbook](https://defog.notion.site/Cookbook-for-schema-definitions-1650a6855ea447fdb0be75d39975571b).

## Uploading your metadata

To upload your metadata to Defog, just pass in the path to your CSV via defog update

```bash
defog update path_to_metadata_csv
```

For example, if your CSV is in the current folder as `defog_metadata.csv`, you should just run `defog update defog_metadata.csv`

## Making a test query

One your metadata has been updated, you can start making test queries. An example query is below

```bash
defog query 'how many users do we have?'
```

## (Optional) Deploying to AWS Lambda or GCP Functions

If you want to deploy Defog a a microservice on your cloud, you can run the following functions:

```bash
# for AWS Lambda
# before this, you must install chalice with `pip install chalice`
defog deploy aws
```

```bash
# for GCP Functions
# before this, you must have gcloud installed on your machine
defog deploy gcp
```

Once you do this, you will see the API endpoint for your microservice in your console
